2) Optimize fog of war raycasts
3) Only certain numbers work for the FogOfWar.cs fog resolution. 180, 90, 72, 120, etc. Others will leave a gap in the raycasts, from roughly 270 degrees to exactly 360
4) Make FunctionalObject.cs take cursor info from GameSetup.cs
5) In FogOfWar.cs, edge adjustment is disabled because it's broken
6) Camera shouldn't track when player jumps. This is hard, because they don't always land on the same level, if it all
7) Player "adjusts" when moving for the first time
8) Make enemy detection more consistent
9) Hard shadows to make seeing depth easier
10) Crouching should make you move slower
11) Every FunctionalObject has a different reference to their own version of defaultCursor. Tried serializing it within FunctionalObject.cs, tried putting it in GameManager.cs and referencing that
