# City Of The Damned
## What Is The Game?
City of the Damned (working title) is a 2.5D survival horror game similar to This War of Mine. It takes place in a dense city after some mysterious apocalypse that took out humanity referred to as "the nightmare"

## Story Synopsis
The story's not 100% there yet, but the gist of it is you're on death row, living out the night you killed your family. The horrible creatures that wander the streets are representations of your family that are stuck in your head

## The Settings
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic city referred to only as "the nightmare", and is largely open-world. You can travel via the surface, going through skyscrapers and neighorhoods, via the subway, faster and safer but cold and labyrinthine, or via "the mother", a huge spider-like machine collapsed over most of the city

## Mechanics
The primary mechanics are stealth, gunplay, and the huge amount of interactivity with the world. Nearly any object can be used in some way, and you'll have to worry about ammo counts and your body temperature often
